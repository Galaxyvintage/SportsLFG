# SportsLFG
#####Note: 
1. Developed using XCode 7.1 and Swift 2.0. Using lower versions of either one could result in errors

2. Run the .xcworkspace file instead of .xcodeproj file because Kinvey's APIs is included using cocoapod

3. The features we have now in our Version 1 are 
1) creating account(with PK = email address), 
2) editing initial profile(cannot edit in this version), 
3) create groups (can only creat football and pingpong),
4) looking for groups(in group list which will show all groups in the database).

4. Features we donot have in Version 1 are 
1) changing your account password, 
2) edit your profile in your profile page, 
3) group list shows only that kind of sports(indoor, outdoor, gym, etc.),
4) group map view, 
5) team view(show your current team info), 
6) schedule view(show schedule of your groups), 
7) and More view(show stuff like healthkit, ) .

5. Features we will have in Version 2 is fullfilling what we should do in V1 and also viewing groups in Map view (shows groups near you), checking your team, stuff related with HealthKit.
